        ***** Comparison between multiple SPA apps with React *****
      </p>
      <p>
        When comparing Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with React, it's
        essential to consider various factors such as performance, scalability,
        developer experience, and community support. React has been a popular
        choice for building SPAs due to its component-based architecture,
        efficient updates, and strong ecosystem. Below, we'll compare SPAs
        developed with React across different criteria.
      </p>
      <section className={styles.column2}>
        <div>
          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Performance:-</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              React excels in performance due to its virtual DOM and efficient
              diffing algorithm, which minimizes direct manipulation of the DOM.
              This leads to faster rendering times and smoother user
              experiences, especially in complex applications with frequent
              state changes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Scalability:-</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              React's component-based architecture makes it highly scalable.
              Developers can build large applications composed of reusable
              components, making maintenance easier and promoting consistency
              across the application. Additionally, React supports server-side
              rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) through
              frameworks like Next.js, enhancing SEO and performance for
              large-scale applications.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Developer Experience:-</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              React offers a rich developer experience with a wide range of
              tools and libraries. The ecosystem includes state management
              solutions (Redux, MobX), routing libraries (React Router), and
              development tools (Create React App). However, the vast number of
              options can sometimes overwhelm new developers. React's
              documentation and community support help mitigate this challenge.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Community Support:-</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              React benefits from strong community support and extensive
              resources, including tutorials, forums, and third-party libraries.
              This vibrant ecosystem contributes to rapid innovation and helps
              solve common challenges faced by developers.

        Comparison with Other SPA Frameworks:-
      </h3>
      <p>
        While React is a powerful tool for building SPAs, it's worth comparing
        it with other popular frameworks and libraries:
      </p>
      <div className={styles.inlineItems}>
        <ul className={styles.wid60}>
          <li>
            <strong> Angular:-</strong> Offers a comprehensive framework with
            strong opinions on application structure, leading to consistency
            across projects. Angular's learning curve is steeper compared to
            React, but it provides out-of-the-box solutions for many common
            needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Vue.js:- </strong> Known for its simplicity and ease of
            integration, Vue.js strikes a balance between flexibility and
            opinionation. It has a smaller footprint compared to React and
            Angular, making it suitable for smaller projects or teams looking
            for rapid development cycles.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure className={styles.wid40}>
          <img src={techImage} alt="technologies" />
        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>
        React Trending Sub Libraries/Frameworks:-
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vite:- </strong>Vite uses native ES modules in the browser and
          only bundles code during production builds, leading to a much faster
          development experience compared to traditional bundlers. Ideal for
          creating small to medium-sized applications, especially when you want
          to focus on the development experience and speed. Vite is primarily a
          build tool that enhances the development experience but doesn't
          provide the full-stack features like routing or server-side rendering.
          It's best for projects where speed and simplicity are key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Next.js:- </strong>
          Next.js is a mature, full-stack framework that excels in projects
          where you need server-side rendering, static site generation, and
          integrated backend functionality. Suitable for building SEO-friendly
          websites, e-commerce platforms, and any application that benefits from
          SSR or SSG. It's also great for full-stack applications due to its
          built-in API routes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remix:- </strong>
          Ideal for applications that require complex routing, a strong focus on
          performance, and a seamless user experience. It's particularly
          well-suited for apps where you want to blend server-rendered and
          client-rendered content smoothly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className={styles.subTitle}>Conclusion:-</h3>

      <p>
        It's fast, easy to learn, and there's a big community always ready to
        help. Plus, lots of big companies like Netflix and Instagram use it, so
        it must be pretty good!
